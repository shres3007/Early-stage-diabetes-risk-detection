# Early-stage-diabetes-risk-detection

Diabetes is a disorder where there is no proper secretion of insulin. This disorder will not regulate the sugar levels in the blood. It is known that this is primarily because of the imbalance in the hormones. More than 1.6 billion people leave this world because of this disorder. Back in my country India this is a very common disorder which does not have any permanent cure. The only way is to maintain the blood glucose level and monitor them with utmost determination. The motive of choosing the work on diabetes is because of couple of personal incidents. Half of my family whose age is greater than 50 years is affected by diabetes. This really motivates me to choose this subject for my Machine Learning project which gives me more understanding about the factors affecting the disorder. This study might give me more insights towards the understanding of determination of diabetes in the early stage. In this way we can prolog the disorder or even stand still against it along the life without getting affected to it.
